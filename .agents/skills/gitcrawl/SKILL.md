# Gitcrawl

Use local archive data first for GitHub issue and pull request questions. Browse
or hit live GitHub APIs only when the local archive is stale, missing the
requested scope, or the user asks for current external context.

## Sources

- Config: `~/.config/gitcrawl/config.toml`
- DB: resolve with `gitcrawl doctor --json`; portable-store installs may point at `~/.config/gitcrawl/stores/gitcrawl-store/data/openclaw__openclaw.sync.db` instead of the default local DB
- Cache: `~/.config/gitcrawl/cache`
- Vectors: `~/.config/gitcrawl/vectors`
- Repo: `openclaw/gitcrawl`; on ClawSweeper this is checked out at `~/clawsweeper-workspace/gitcrawl`
- Preferred CLI: `gitcrawl`; fallback to `go run ./cmd/gitcrawl` from a verified repo checkout if the installed binary is stale

## Freshness

For recent/current questions, check freshness before analysis:

```bash
gitcrawl doctor --json
```

Routine refresh:

```bash
gitcrawl doctor
gitcrawl refresh owner/repo
```

Targeted refresh:

```bash
gitcrawl sync owner/repo --numbers 123,456 --with pr-details
```

`--with pr-details` hydrates PR files, commits, checks, workflow runs, and
review-thread resolution state. Use it when cached PR status reports missing PR
details, unknown checks, or unknown review-thread resolution.

For agent-driven discovery, prefer bounded freshness:

```bash
gitcrawl search issues "query" -R owner/repo --state open --sync-if-stale 5m --json number,title,url
```

## Query Workflow

1. Resolve scope: owner/repo, issue/PR number, cluster id, keyword, label, author, state, or date range.
2. Check freshness for recent/current requests.
3. Use CLI for normal reads; use read-only SQL for precise counts/rankings.
4. Report absolute date spans, repo names, issue/PR numbers, cluster ids, and known gaps.

Common commands:

```bash
gitcrawl search issues "query" -R owner/repo --state open --json number,title,url
gitcrawl clusters owner/repo --sort size --min-size 5
gitcrawl cluster-detail owner/repo --id <id>
gitcrawl gh pr status 123 -R owner/repo --compact
gitcrawl gh pr view 123 -R owner/repo --json number,title,state,url
```

For PR triage, start with cached status, then drill down only into blockers:

```bash
gitcrawl gh pr status <number-or-url> -R owner/repo --compact
gitcrawl gh pr view <number-or-url> -R owner/repo --json number,title,state,url,isDraft,headRef,headSha
gitcrawl gh pr checks <number-or-url> -R owner/repo --json name,state,conclusion,detailsUrl
```

`pr status` exits `0` clean, `1` action needed, `2` error, or `3` pending. Use `--live` before final merge/comment decisions when liveness matters; it refreshes exact PR details/review threads, then returns the same normalized status shape. Use `--cached` when measuring local cache coverage.

Readiness is conservative: non-open PRs, drafts, failing/unknown checks,
pending checks, merge conflicts or blocked/unknown mergeability, unresolved or
unknown review threads, active requested changes, and missing approval block
ready. Bodyless approvals count. Review state is the latest non-stale decision
per reviewer, so a later approval supersedes an earlier changes-requested.

Default `pr status` may auto-hydrate when the PR row exists but PR details or
review-thread markers are missing. `GITCRAWL_GH_AUTO_HYDRATE=0` and `--cached`
keep it local-only.

## SQL

`gitcrawl` does not currently expose a first-class `sql` command. For exact
local archive counts or rankings, use SQLite read-only mode against the
configured DB and prefer CLI commands for normal reads.

Useful examples:

```bash
db="$(gitcrawl doctor --json | jq -r .db_path)"
sqlite3 -readonly "$db" \
  "select count(*) as threads from threads;"
sqlite3 -readonly "$db" \
  "select r.full_name, count(*) as threads from threads t join repositories r on r.id = t.repo_id group by r.full_name order by threads desc limit 20;"
sqlite3 -readonly "$db" \
  "select state, count(*) as threads from threads group by state;"
```

Do not run mutating SQL against the archive. Use local maintainer commands for
overrides instead of writing database rows directly.

When the installed CLI lacks a new feature, build or run from
a verified `openclaw/gitcrawl` checkout before concluding the feature is missing.

## Maintainer Boundaries

`close-thread`, `close-cluster`, exclusions, and canonical-member choices are
local maintainer overrides; they do not write back to GitHub. Set
`GITCRAWL_GH_PATH` explicitly when using the gh shim so it cannot recurse into
itself.

## Verification

For repo edits, prefer existing Go gates:

```bash
GOWORK=off go test ./...
```

Then run targeted CLI smoke for the touched surface, for example:

```bash
gitcrawl doctor --json
gitcrawl status --json
gitcrawl search issues "test" -R openclaw/gitcrawl --state open --limit 5
gitcrawl gh --live pr status https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/<n> --compact
gitcrawl gh pr status https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/<n> --compact
```
